They then compared pothole data with a range of other conditions, including the presence of bus stops, parking meters, and population. Using statistical algorithms, computer programming languages, and industry-standard software, the team was able to analyze the complex relations between all of the factors and develop recommendations for how the city of San Diego might begin to solve their issues with potholes.

Their solution was “me-mo”, a personal traveling app that helps users keep track of places they’ve been to or want to visit in the future. The team of three approached the project by first studying the needs of users and using storyboards to illustrate the different personas and scenarios in which their app would be used. Working with criticism and review from their classmates, the team went on to rapid prototyping and developing low-fidelity wireframes which were then tested on users. Their final project incorporates a wide array of techniques and insight gained from the COGS 120 course. \n\nThe COGS 120 (Interaction Design) course is structured through weekly skill-building assignments and regular small design studio sessions designed to foster constructive conversations around each team’s progress throughout the quarter.

In response, Len showcases proofs that simplify hash conversion and ultimately bolster safety guarantees of online data. The project promises to increase confidence in the security of people’s everyday interactions.\n\nLen fell in love with cryptography after taking CSE 107 (Introduction to Cryptography). She decided to take CSE 191 (Projects in Cryptography), where she worked with Professor Mihir Bellare and graduate student Joseph Jaeger to develop this project.

To meet with popular demand, since 2011 we have hosted our own competition called the California Micromouse Competition (CAMM) at UC San Diego. Every year, IEEE at UC San Diego receives more than 200 applications and are able to sponsor 40 UC San Diego students to participate in the Micromouse Project, and we also have multiple schools from the west coast attending our competition.\n\nIn 2016, more than half of the awards at CAMM Competition was won by UCSD teams. They are: 2nd Place (Kevin Tain), Most Cells Traversed (Will Bui, Austin Hermida, Jocelyn Tran, Achint Singh, Andy Zhang), Design Award (Javier Urquizu, Eddie Calva, Christopher Lew, Nahoon Hwang), and Judge’s Favorite (Fengjunyan Li, Austin Xiao, Haoran Wang, Zhouhang Shao, Haocheng Liang).

Using the Unity 3D engine, a series of basic puzzles are presented to the player, who is given a time limit to complete each. Upon completing the series of puzzles, the player is thrown back to the first puzzle, and finds that the controls and perspective have been altered, causing the puzzle to increase in difficulty. Each successive loop continues to distort the player’s experience, activating swirling walls of music and overwhelming sensory information as the game progresses. The game acts as a test of endurance in the face of information saturation and only rewards the user with a high score, depending on the amount of loops completed.\n\nThe game was completed with techniques and skills taught in the project-based VIS 141A course under Professor Brett Stalbaum, which allows students to gain API fluency through planning and coding software or software mediated art projects. In particular, this game was programmed with the C++ language and designed in Unity 3D.",

      "description": "“How does gentrification contribute to changes in San Diego demographics? In particular, how do factors such as crime, home value, housing income and racial diversity change as a result of gentrification?”\n\nFor the final project in COGS 108 Data Science in Practice), one team posed this poignant question. The team first approached the issue by identifying gentrified San Diego neighborhoods, and then conducting a range of data visualization and statistical methods in order to meaningfully structure the large amounts of data present. In particular, the team explored how factors such as crime, home value, housing income and racial diversity change as a result of gentrification. Their purpose in exploring the subject was to shed light on a civic concern that’s widely disputed and debated in cities across the country.",

      "description": "The game is designed to be a single player Pong game where the user faces the upper edge of the screen, a randomly generated horizontal wall, and a pong ball with gradually increasing speed. The user must maneuver a small platform, the paddle, to prevent the moving pong ball from passing the lower edge of the screen.\n\nThe screen is split in half where the left side of the display is the actual game, while the right side is a score tracker. The score can be arbitrarily set to determine a winner, for example, the team normally tests the game with a set score of 15.\n\nThe project was built using an Arduino Uno with 1 output and 1 input. For the output, the team daisy chained four 8x8 LED matrices to create a 64x64 grid of red LEDs to create the display screen for the player. For the input, the player uses a traditional joystick, which controls the paddle.",

      "description": "Gokoban is a 3D box-pushing elevator-riding award-winning puzzle game. It was awarded 1st place in the 2017 Gopher Game Jam - an international competition where participants make a game in 3 months using the Go programming language. In the game, players control the Go gopher (the Go mascot) and your objective is to push the boxes until they are all on top of the marked pads. There are elevators that help you reach high places and move boxes up and down. Gokoban was inspired by traditional sokoban-style puzzles but with the added 3D aspect.\n\nGokoban  was created using G3N, an open-source 3D game engine created by Salvadori and his dad. At the time there weren't any active full-fledged game engines in Go, and he decided that building one together would be a great way to have fun while talking about math, algorithms and programming. When he heard about the Gopher Game Jam, Salvadori knew he had to make a game for it using his own 3D engine. \n\nGokoban, like G3N, is also completely open source, meaning all the game source code, sounds, textures, levels and 3D models are freely available online. It’s easy to modify the levels and even create new ones - there's no coding involved!",
