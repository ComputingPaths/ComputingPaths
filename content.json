These four departments offer rigorous and interdisciplinary trainings for this new and evolving field. All of these departments provide courses on molecular biology, computer science and mathematics, while offering emphasis on each of their respective department subjects.",
    "cog": "The cognitive science major is a diverse field that blends together the understanding of the brain, human behavior, and computation. Students can choose between five different specializations that span widely different disciplines including neurological & biological sciences, computational sciences, social sciences, and visual arts. Students can explore a variety of disciplines including neurological & biological sciences, computational sciences, social sciences, and visual arts, determined by their chosen specialization. Graduates of this program often go on to graduate school or work in research, UX and product design, and data analysis.",
    "cse": "The Computer Science major allows students to initially explore computer science through algorithmic problem solving and programming in various languages, including Java and C. Students then progress to topics involving a deeper understanding of computer systems including advanced data structures and computer architecture. Additional elective courses provide depth into systems and networks, database analysis, security and cryptography topics, machine learning, computer vision, and graphics. Many graduates of this program go on to graduate school or choose careers that involve machine automation, UI/UX design, data analytics, application development, artificial intelligence, networking, and security.",
    "ece": "Both Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering involve understanding of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism in addition to computational knowledge. Students can choose to have more of a balance between software and hardware as computer engineers or a greater emphasis on hardware as electrical engineers.",
    "mcs": "The Math-Computer Science (B.S) major is a specialized branch of mathematics, providing a focus on computer science. While not covering the same scope as a pure Computer Science major, Math CS prepares students to potentially work in a computing setting. Students are given flexibility in their course subjects, allowing the opportunity to have a greater focus on mathematics or to take a more even distribution of courses in mathematics and computer science. Students study subjects including abstract algebra, statistics and probability, combinatorics, algorithm analysis, programming, and data structures.",
    "sci": "[Placeholder - there are two departments in this category: math and physics]",
    "ica": "The Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts major (ICAM) is an exciting blend of computer science, art, and technology that explores today’s cutting-edge media. Access to a wide range of disciplines means that students are free to tailor the program to their artistic interests, and can take classes in fields like virtual reality, design communication, film production, and physical electronics programming. ICAM students gain technical, theoretical, and historical backgrounds that prepare them to anticipate and work with emerging trends in art, music, and technology. They can choose from either music technology or visual arts focuses, which influence their upper-level coursework, but often draw from both fields during their journey through the major.",
    "spc": "The Speculative Design (B.A.) major mixes art, science, and emerging technology, with a focus on aesthetics, entrepreneurship, and activist intervention. Combining laboratory and field research in a creative studio setting, Speculative Design works from nano to urban scales to stimulate new ideas and innovative solutions. Rather than focusing on existing methodologies, this program prepares students to solve problems that will emerge in an uncertain future. Students may choose from four areas of emphasis: Public Culture and Urban Ecology, Design Computing, Design Research, and Media Design. ",
    "dat": "Data science majors use mathematical models and computational methods to craft powerful data analysis and meet the emerging needs of data-driven industries, from manufacturing companies to government organizations. The core knowledge base of the data scientist lies at the intersection of computing and mathematics, coupled with the skills to abstract, build, and test predictive and descriptive models. Students in the program can expect coursework in mathematics, computer science, and statistics, as well as foundational lower division coursework in natural and physical sciences."

      "description": "Working with immense amounts of data, a team of cognitive science students tackle the growing pothole problem in San Diego.\n\n“People have become so desensitized to potholes that their frustration with them has become an everyday routine. For the safety of people and their cars, we asked, what approaches can be taken towards increasing the efficiency of pothole repair? And where should San Diego be allocating their pothole workers and resources?”\n\nThose were the questions asked by a team of students taking the COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) course. Working with immense amounts of public data, the team first generated visual heat maps of San Diego potholes with the help of the ArcGIS program. They then compared pothole data with a range of other conditions, including the presence of bus stops, parking meters, and population. Using statistical algorithms, computer programming languages, and industry-standard software, the team was able to analyze the complex relations between all of the factors and develop recommendations for how the city of San Diego might begin to solve their issues with potholes. The project demonstrates the practicality of a computing-based approach in data science.",

In response to the topic Visualizing and Interacting with Histories, Tori Duong (‘18), Melissa Ngu (‘17), and Ed Ngai (‘17) wondered how they might help people represent and interact with histories in a visual way. Their solution was “me-mo”, a personal traveling app that helps users keep track of places they’ve been to or want to visit in the future. The team of three approached the project by first studying the needs of users and using storyboards to illustrate the different personas and scenarios in which their app would be used. Working with criticism and review from their classmates, the team went on to rapid prototyping and developing low-fidelity wireframes which were then tested on users. Their final project incorporates a wide array of techniques and insight gained from the COGS 120 course. \n\nThe COGS 120 (Interaction Design) course is structured through weekly skill-building assignments and regular small design studio sessions designed to foster constructive conversations around each team’s progress throughout the quarter.

The competition featured a 16x16 grid maze and was led by a wall-following robot-mouse, with objective to solve the maze as fast as possible without outside assistant or human control. To meet with popular demand, since 2011 we have hosted our own competition called the California Micromouse Competition (CAMM) at UC San Diego. Every year, IEEE at UC San Diego receives more than 200 applications and are able to sponsor 40 UC San Diego students to participate in the Micromouse Project, and we also have multiple schools from the west coast attending our competition.\n\nIn 2016, more than half of the awards at CAMM Competition was won by UCSD teams. They are: 2nd Place (Kevin Tain), Most Cells Traversed (Will Bui, Austin Hermida, Jocelyn Tran, Achint Singh, Andy Zhang), Design Award (Javier Urquizu, Eddie Calva, Christopher Lew, Nahoon Hwang), and Judge’s Favorite (Fengjunyan Li, Austin Xiao, Haoran Wang, Zhouhang Shao, Haocheng Liang). This project is an opportunity for students to learn and apply various hands-on skills critical for electrical engineers and computer scientists, including EagleCAD, digital signal processing, and microcontroller programming. Other than the technical skills, it is equally important for students to develop collaboration and research skills to help them along the way working in a competitive environment.",

Using the Unity 3D engine, a series of basic puzzles are presented to the player, who is given a time limit to complete each. Upon completing the series of puzzles, the player is thrown back to the first puzzle, and finds that the controls and perspective have been altered, causing the puzzle to increase in difficulty. Each successive loop continues to distort the player’s experience, activating swirling walls of music and overwhelming sensory information as the game progresses. The game acts as a test of endurance in the face of information saturation and only rewards the user with a high score, depending on the amount of loops completed.\n\nThe game was completed with techniques and skills taught in the project-based VIS 141A course under Professor Brett Stalbaum, which allows students to gain API fluency through planning and coding software or software mediated art projects. In particular, this game was programmed with the C++ language and designed in Unity 3D.",

The user must maneuver a small platform, the paddle, to prevent the moving pong ball from passing the lower edge of the screen.\n\nThe screen is split in half where the left side of the display is the actual game, while the right side is a score tracker. The score can be arbitrarily set to determine a winner, for example, the team normally tests the game with a set score of 15.\n\nThe project was built using an Arduino Uno with 1 output and 1 input. For the output, the team daisy chained four 8x8 LED matrices to create a 64x64 grid of red LEDs to create the display screen for the player. For the input, the player uses a traditional joystick, which controls the paddle.",

It was awarded 1st place in the 2017 Gopher Game Jam - an international competition where participants make a game in 3 months using the Go programming language. In the game, players control the Go gopher (the Go mascot) and your objective is to push the boxes until they are all on top of the marked pads. There are elevators that help you reach high places and move boxes up and down. Gokoban was inspired by traditional sokoban-style puzzles but with the added 3D aspect.\n\nGokoban  was created using G3N, an open-source 3D game engine created by Salvadori and his dad. At the time there weren't any active full-fledged game engines in Go, and he decided that building one together would be a great way to have fun while talking about math, algorithms and programming. When he heard about the Gopher Game Jam, Salvadori knew he had to make a game for it using his own 3D engine. \n\nGokoban, like G3N, is also completely open source, meaning all the game source code, sounds, textures, levels and 3D models are freely available online. It’s easy to modify the levels and even create new ones - there's no coding involved!",
